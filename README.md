# ML-project---Precipitation-and-Temperature-
The objective of this project was twofold: 
1) Establish a relationship between precipitation and temperature and check if precipitation directly affects temperature or not.
2) To predict precipitation values by training the model on past data.
In this project, the first step was to get the mean values of the temperature and the precipitation using the groupby function. Next step was to plot the average values of the temperatue and the precipitation for the first 10 dates.
Doing so gave me a better idea on how to chart out the relationship between temperature and precipitation.
Next, using linear regression, the relationship between temperature and precipitation was checked. The score came out to be 0 which means there was no relationship established.
Finally, to predict precipitation values, I used a regression decision tree to calculate the values.
